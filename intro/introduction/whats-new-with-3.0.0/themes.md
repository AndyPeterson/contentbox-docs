# Themes

We have also updated the theming engine in ContentBox with ColdBox 4 goodness and extreme modularity. Here you can find the major updates for the theming engine.

## Themes not Layouts

Themes is our new mantra. We have transitioned layouts to what we now call ContentBox Themes. They have been revamped to support ColdBox 4.

## New Theme.cfc

The theme descriptor CFC is now named `Theme.cfc`. Backwards compatibility still remains, but now the new descriptor will provide a nice way for editors and tools to target.

## Theme Setting Groups

You can now create theme setting groups in the theme descriptor `Theme.cfc` and the new admin UI will present them in a categorized and ordered format. This is a great way to visualize theme settings.

## Theme Modules

Themes can now include ContentBox modules in a new folder convention called `modules`. This allows you to ship your theme with 1 or a billion modules.

## New Theme Events

The theme life-cycle now presents several new events:

* `cbadmin_preThemeSettingsSave` - Before saving theme settings
* `cbadmin_postThemeSettingsSave` - After saving theme settings
* `cbadmin_onThemeSettings` - When displaying theme settings in the admin UI
* `cbadmin_onThemeInfo` - When displaying theme information on the admin UI
