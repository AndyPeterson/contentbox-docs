# What's New in 3.6.0

This release was all about improvements to the core, localization and internationalization for sites, many bug fixes, UI improvements and updates to our containerization strategy.  Please see below the major areas of improvement and our full release notes.

## New Installer Module

The installer module is now available as a standalone module using the slug `contentbox-installer-module`.  This will improve our container and your container strategy as now you can bring in the installer on demand via CommandBox.

```bash
install contentbox-installer-module
```
